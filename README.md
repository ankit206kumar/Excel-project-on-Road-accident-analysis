# Excel-project-on-Road-accident-analysis
This project involves the analysis of road accident data using Microsoft Excel, with a focus on creating and interpreting pivot tables. 
The dataset includes various attributes such as accident location, time, cause, vehicle type, and casualties. 
By leveraging pivot tables, the project aims to identify key patterns and trends, 
such as the most common causes of accidents, peak accident times, and high-risk areas. 
The analysis will help in understanding the factors contributing to road accidents and assist in developing strategies for improving road safety.
